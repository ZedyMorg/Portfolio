- **E-Commerce analysis**
  - This was a project made during my data analysis studies. Throughout this project, I've had to clean the datasets (NaNs, extreme values, change the type of data), performe EDA (exploratory data analysis), Perform cohort analysis based on retention rate and RFM segmentation (Recency, Frequency, Monetary).
- **Mechanic's shop project**
  - In this project, I've created two datasets simulating some mechanic's shop activities and a promotion based on random choices.
    
- **Data Parsing**
  - **Tft Project**
    -  In this project, I've imported APIs from Riot Games to be able to analyse data from matches played by a player according to their in game name.
 
  - **Steam + Web scrapping**
      - In this project, I've collected data on guides for Civilization VI leaders from a user on steam community and created a dataframe matching my information (scraped from Steam API) on either I have a win with with this leader or no to be able to select leaders I haven't played yet based on their strenght (Culture, Science, etc).
