# Teamfight Tactics

Teamfight tactics (TFT) is a RiotGames autobattler (a round-based PvP game where you need to draft a team that battles automatically on your behalf).

In this project, I fetched APIs from RiotGames to be able to analyze some trends in a specific player match based on their in game name ("IGN"), see what compositions are the most successful for that player and average game placements.
